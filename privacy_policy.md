# Privacy Policy – Meet Popup Extension

**Last updated:** 19/09/2025

Meet Popup Extension (“the Extension”) is a browser extension designed to improve the Google Meet experience by allowing users to open participant videos in separate popup windows.  

## Information Collection and Use  
- The Extension does **not collect, store, or share any personal information**.  
- No user data is transmitted to external servers.  
- The Extension only operates on *meet.google.com* and only modifies the user interface locally in your browser.  

## Permissions  
The Extension requests the following permissions:  
- **Scripting**: Needed to inject a small script into the Google Meet page in order to display the popup button.  
- **Tabs**: Required to open and manage popup windows linked to your Meet session.  
- **Host Permission (meet.google.com)**: Limited exclusively to Google Meet, ensuring the Extension works only within the intended site.  

## Data Security  
Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of third-party access to user information. All actions remain confined to the user’s browser.  

## Third-Party Services  
The Extension does not use analytics, trackers, or third-party services.
